11101,Hello
11102,"From today, I will assist the director."
11103,Are you surprised that you are more like a team than you think?
11104,You rude…
11105,"Well, I don't usually think that the last team's last team will have the right facilities."
11106,I didn't expect to be able to serve the bishop.
11107,I'm a person who has done everything except the championship championship
11108,Is it sensitive?
11109,But what should I do? You already have a down payment… Am I employment?
11110,… .
11111,Huhu… just joke.
11112,"Then, will you go to register first?"
11113,Isn't it too urgent?
11114,The game is not long. It's in a hurry.
11115,"Then, Move quickly!"
11116,Do you remember how to register an entry?
11117,… .
11118,Isn't it too long?
11119,Please click on the part I point.
11120,Click here and register a player.
11121,There are only five teams on our team.
11122,Did you register the entry?
11123,Good job! I'll compliment you.
11124,What is good of praise?
11125,Praise is just good!
11126,then… I also decided to enter the entry…
11127,Would you please set the team name?
11128,"Yes, the club is that… I think it would be nice if the bishop decided."
11129,It's a good name.
11130,"I decided to go to the game, so let's go to prepare for the game."
11131,Is it too fast?
11132,You've been in a hurry?
11133,Then shall we go to the game?
11134,Please click here.
11135,Then! This is the first appearance.
11136,Would you please explain your strategy to each player?
11137,"Most of the players do it anyway, but…"
11138,"Which line will you go? I'm aggressive if it's defensive, but I think you can set it."
11139,The details are that the game starts and judges.
11140,"If you press here, you can choose which strategy to use."
11141,The defensive strategy is to play a defense of the tower and the Nexus.
11142,The aggressive strategy focuses on destroying the opponent's Nexus.
11143,"You can choose one by one, but"
11144,You can also click the button here to give the players to some extent.
11145,"If you chose the strategy, shall we really start the game?"
11146,Can you see the players?
11147,The screen you see now is the in -game panel.
11148,Would you like to change the line once?
11149,Drag the icon of the player I designated.
11150,"Yes, you did well. When the manager was a player, the instructions would have been descended."
11151,I changed the line too…
11152,Can you see the button under the right right.
11153,You can order the players to do as a whole with that button.
11154,Defensive orders stop the attack and protect the tower
11155,Attackless power moves around enemy Nexus destruction.
11156,It's the last explanation now.
11157,under… It was long.
11158,Would you please click on this player's icon?
11159,Do you see it enlarged?
11160,"On this screen, you can give them an individual command."
11161,"If you click anywhere in the player's icon or panel, you will return to the existing screen."
11162,"Yes, please finish the game now!"
11163,You have a hard time!
11164,ah! I have a good news for the bishop.
11165,"There are only five players in our team, right?"
